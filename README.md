## Random API Philosophical Quotes  
This repository contains the code for my random philosophical image quote API. To access an example, simply put http://54.242.56.206:4000/generate_image
into your web browser, to put this in your own github readme, use this link for a generated image that takes in the current timestamp as a parameter
