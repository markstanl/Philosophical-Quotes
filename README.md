# Philosophical-Quotes
!ISSUES! 3/22/2024
I, unfortunately, have had to remove it from my ubuntu EC2 instance, as this single script costs around $20/month, based on how LONG the server is runningâ€”an entirely unnecessary price.
What's next? I will try and find a way to host it on some other service for cheaper. The code STILL absolutely works and we have some updated quotes    
## Random API Philosophical Quotes  
This repository contains the code for my random philosophical image quote API. To access an example, simply put http://54.242.56.206:4000/generate_image
into your web browser, to put this in your GitHub readme, use this link for a generated image that takes in the current timestamp as a parameter. The list
of quotes is stored in a python file. Some of these quotes may be seen as controversial, I may not necessarily agree with every quote, but I think many 
are very interesting summaries of the important points these philosophers are trying to make.
